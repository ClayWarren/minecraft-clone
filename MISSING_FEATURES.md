## Summary

**Most Critical Missing Systems:**
1. **Mobs and Entities** - Core gameplay experience
2. **Furnaces/Smelting** - Essential progression system  
3. **Food/Hunger** - Survival mechanics
4. **Redstone** - Automation and creativity
5. **Dimensions** - End-game content

**Current State:** We have a solid foundation with world generation, basic building, crafting, and multiplayer, but we're missing approximately 60-70% of Minecraft's core systems for a "complete replica."
