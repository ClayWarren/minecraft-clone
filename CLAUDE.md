## Development Priorities

### IMPORTANT: Focus on Core Minecraft Gameplay

When working on this codebase, prioritize implementing authentic Minecraft mechanics:

#### Phase 1: Block System (Current Priority)

1. **Block Entities**: Create block entities with proper voxel positioning
2. **Block Interaction**: Left-click to mine, right-click to place
3. **Block Types**: Basic blocks (grass, dirt, stone, wood)
4. **Simple Inventory**: Basic item storage for collected blocks

#### Phase 2: World Generation

1. **Chunk System**: 16x16 block chunks for infinite worlds
2. **Terrain Generation**: Height maps and basic biomes
3. **Block Placement**: Proper voxel world structure
4. **World Persistence**: Save/load chunk data

#### Phase 3: Minecraft Mechanics

1. **Mining System**: Tool requirements and block hardness
2. **Crafting**: Workbench and basic recipes
3. **Player Progression**: Tool durability and upgrades
4. **Inventory UI**: Proper Minecraft-style interface

#### Phase 4: Advanced Features

1. **Multiplayer**: Real-time world synchronization
2. **Mobs**: Basic creature AI and spawning
3. **Weather**: Day/night cycle and environmental effects
4. **Structures**: Villages, dungeons, and generated buildings

### Code Quality for Minecraft Systems

**Quality Standards:**
- **Code Quality**: All code passes ESLint validation with zero errors/warnings
- **Formatting**: Consistent Prettier formatting across the entire codebase
- **Testing**: Write tests for new features, maintain 214+ passing tests
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing for block IDs, item types, and world coordinates
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automatic quality gates prevent broken commits

**Architecture Standards:**
- **AAA Game Development**: Use professional systems (object pooling, fixed timestep, profiling)
- **Memory Management**: Efficient object pooling and garbage collection optimization
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time profiling of frame times and memory usage
- **Voxel Optimization**: Use efficient data structures and instanced rendering for blocks
- **Component Design**: Keep block, item, and world data in separate components
- **System Separation**: Dedicated systems for world, crafting, inventory, and performance

## Current Minecraft Implementation Notes

### Block Coordinate System

Use standard Minecraft-style coordinates:

- Y-axis: Vertical (0 = bedrock level)
- X/Z-axis: Horizontal world coordinates
- Chunk coordinates: World coordinates divided by 16

### Voxel Rendering Strategy

- **Instanced Rendering**: High-performance rendering system for thousands of identical blocks
- **Memory Optimization**: Object pooling for Three.js Vector3, Euler, and Matrix4 objects
- **Performance Profiling**: Real-time monitoring of rendering performance and memory usage
- **Face Culling**: Hidden block face optimization for better performance
- **Texture Atlasing**: Efficient material usage with texture atlases

### Multiplayer Architecture

- Server-side world authority for anti-cheat
- Client prediction for responsive block placement
- Chunk streaming to reduce bandwidth
- Delta compression for world updates

## Development Best Practices for Minecraft

1. **Minecraft-First Development**: Every feature should serve the Minecraft experience
2. **AAA Game Development Standards**: Use professional systems (object pooling, fixed timestep, profiling)
3. **Code Quality First**: Use `npm run check` before committing, write tests for new features
4. **Performance Optimization**: Leverage instanced rendering, object pooling, and memory profiling
5. **Authentic Mechanics**: Study original Minecraft behavior for accuracy
6. **Modular Systems**: Use ECS to separate world, physics, crafting, and networking
7. **Type Safety**: Prevent bugs with strong TypeScript typing for game data

### Development Workflow

**Before implementing new features:**
1. Run `npm run check` to ensure existing code is clean
2. Write failing tests for the new feature
3. Implement the feature with proper TypeScript types
4. Ensure all tests pass (`npm test`)
5. Run `npm run fix` to auto-format code
6. Commit changes (pre-commit hooks ensure quality)

## Next Steps for Minecraft Implementation

**Immediate Priority**: Implement basic block placement/destruction system to demonstrate core Minecraft voxel interaction using the ECS architecture and new AAA game development systems.

This will establish the foundation for all other Minecraft features and validate the TypeScript ECS approach with professional game development practices for voxel-based gameplay.
